# Chisel-Single-Cycle-RISC-V-32I
This is the chisel generated verilog in which the instruction memory and data memory is written in verilog by my own.
Here is the Fibonacci Series running on FPGA Arty-7 xc7a35ticsg324-1L. On FPGA board we have "4 RGB" leds(LD0,LD1,LD2,LD3) where as in my case "LD0 => RGB" Blue led is the Least Significant Bit(LSB) and "LD3 => RGB" Red led is the Most Significant Bit(MSB).
