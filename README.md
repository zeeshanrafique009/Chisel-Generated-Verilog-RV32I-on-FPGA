# Chisel-Single-Cycle-RISC-V-32I
This is the chisel generated verilog in which the instruction memory and data memory is written in verilog by my own.
Here is the Fibonacci Series running on FPGA Arty-7 xc7a35ticsg324-1L on 7-segment diplays in hexadecimal format. 
The pattren is ( 1,2,3,5,8,d,15,22,37,59,90,E9,179,262,3dB,63d ) after 63d the series will reset and starts from 1 again.
